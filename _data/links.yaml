  title: Differential Effects of Antiseptic Mouth Rinses on SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity In Vitro
  date: 2021-03-01
  description: "
    Abstract
    Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is detectable in saliva from asymptomatic individuals, suggesting a potential benefit from the use of mouth rinses to suppress viral load and reduce virus spread. Published studies on the reduction of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytotoxic effects by mouth rinses do not exclude antiseptic mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity. Here, we determined the effect of commercially available mouth rinses and antiseptic povidone-iodine on the infectivity of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We first determined the effect of mouth rinses on cell viability to ensure that antiviral activity was not a consequence of mouth rinse-induced cytotoxicity. Colgate Peroxyl (hydrogen peroxide) exhibited the most cytotoxicity, followed by povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), and Listerine (essential oils and alcohol). The potent antiviral activities of Colgate Peroxyl mouth rinse and povidone-iodine were the consequence of rinse-mediated cellular damage when the products were present during infection. The potency of CHG was greater when the product was not washed off after virus attachment, suggesting that the prolonged effect of mouth rinses on cells impacts the antiviral outcome. To minimalize mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, mouth rinse was largely removed from treated viruses by centrifugation prior to infection of cells. A 5% (v/v) dilution of Colgate Peroxyl or povidone-iodine completely blocked viral infectivity. A similar 5% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG had a moderate suppressive effect on the virus, but a 50% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG blocked viral infectivity completely. Mouth rinses inactivated the virus without prolonged incubation. The new infectivity assay, with limited impacts of mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, showed the differential effects of mouth rinses on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results indicate that mouth rinses can significantly reduce virus infectivity, suggesting a potential benefit for reducing SARS-CoV-2 spread."

  title: 2 Mouthwashes Disrupt the Coronavirus in Lab Tests
  date: 2022-01-17
  description: "
    Two types of mouthwash disrupt SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, preventing it from replicating in a human cell, a new study suggests.

    The study in the journal Pathogens finds that, in a laboratory setting, Listerine and the prescription mouthwash Chlorhexidine disrupted the virus within seconds after researchers diluted it to concentrations that would mimic actual use.

    Further studies are needed to test real-life efficacy in humans."

  title: It Is Time to Face Reality About the Vaccines
  date: 2022-01-15
  description: "
    A number of studies are converging on the fact that 2 doses of vaccination has poor vaccine effectiveness against Omicron. 3 doses does slightly better, but the effect will rapidly wane as antibody titers fall, and infection is certain as the number of exposures increase. These studies have immediate implications for vaccine and health-care policies.

    First, Kaiser Southern California. Here are data for 2 doses of mRNA for effectiveness against Omicron. Follow the red line. Over time, it is 0 percent."

  date: 2022-01-16
  description: "
    It is a “waste of time” to keep vaccinating people against the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, the former chairman of Britain’s Vaccines Taskforce has said.

    Dr. Clive Dix, who played a key role in helping pharmaceutical firms create the COVID-19 vaccines, told LBC radio on Jan. 16: “The Omicron variant is a relatively mild virus. And to just keep vaccinating people and thinking of doing it again to protect the population is, in my view, now a waste of time.”

    Dix said the focus now should be on protecting vulnerable people, such as those over 60, 2 percent of whom remain unvaccinated."

  title: End mass jabs and live with Covid, says ex-head of vaccine taskforce
  date: 2022-01-15
  description: "
    Covid should be treated as an endemic virus similar to flu, and ministers should end mass-vaccination after the booster campaign, the former chairman of the UK’s vaccine taskforce has said.

    With health chiefs and senior Tories also lobbying for a post-pandemic plan for a straining NHS, Dr Clive Dix called for a major rethink of the UK’s Covid strategy, in effect reversing the approach of the past two years and returning to a “new normality”.

    “We need to analyse whether we use the current booster campaign to ensure the vulnerable are protected, if this is seen to be necessary,” he said. “Mass population-based vaccination in the UK should now end.”"

    Joe Rogan has been criticised for helping spread misinformation on his podcast.

    Spotify reportedly paid $100m (£75m) in 2020 for rights to The Joe Rogan Experience, which is the streaming service's top podcast. It is reportedly downloaded almost 200 million times a month.

    On the show, the US broadcaster hosts a wide variety of guests who discuss their views on a range of topics - but some episodes have featured false and misleading claims.

  title: 'A LITERATURE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF LOCKDOWNS ON COVID-19 MORTALITY'
  date: 2022-01-30
  description: "
    This systematic review and meta-analysis are designed to determine whether there is empirical evidence to support the belief that “lockdowns” reduce COVID-19 mortality. Lockdowns are defined as the imposition of at least one compulsory, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). NPIs are any government mandate that directly restrict peoples’ possibilities, such as policies that limit internal movement, close schools and businesses, and ban international travel. This study employed a systematic search and screening procedure in which 18,590 studies are identified that could potentially address the belief posed. After three levels of screening, 34 studies ultimately qualified. Of those 34 eligible studies, 24 qualified for inclusion in the meta-analysis. They were separated into three groups: lockdown stringency index studies, shelter-in-place- order (SIPO) studies, and specific NPI studies. An analysis of each of these three groups support the conclusion that lockdowns have had little to no effect on COVID-19 mortality. More specifically, stringency index studies find that lockdowns in Europe and the United States only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 0.2% on average. SIPOs were also ineffective, only reducing COVID-19 mortality by 2.9% on average. Specific NPI studies also find no broad-based evidence of noticeable effects on COVID-19 mortality.
    While this meta-analysis concludes that lockdowns have had little to no public health effects, they have imposed enormous economic and social costs where they have been adopted. In consequence, lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.

  title: 'A autópsia do pequeno Rodrigo: a verdade da mentira ou a confiança nula'

  description: "
    As Autoridades de Saúde – englobemos aqui a Direcção-Geral da Saúde (DGS), administrações hospitalares e institutos públicos deste sector, entre os quais o Instituto Nacional de Saúde Dr. Ricardo Jorge (INSA), o Infarmed e o Instituto de Medicina Legal – que nos garantem agora que a trágica morte do pequeno Rodrigo nada teve a ver com a vacina contra a covid-19, são as mesmas que nos asseguraram que uma bebé prematura, nascida no início do ano passado no Hospital Garcia de Orta, com uma hemorragia intraventricular de grau 4, afinal teve como causa de óbito as infecções por SARS-CoV-2, à conta de um simples teste positivo.
    Que se saiba, as tais Autoridades de Saúde não se mostraram então tão zelosas em autópsias detalhadas para confirmar se a morte foi por covid-19 ou, enfim, por uma hemorragia intraventricular de grau 4. Não sou médico, mas nem é preciso ser especialista para desconfiar. Mas, neste caso, não interessou averiguar. Nem sobre esta morte, nem sobre a de um outro bebé com menos de 1 anos, nem de outra de uma criança de 4 anos, também com graves comorbilidades, nem a de uma jovem de 19 anos que sofria de síndrome de Dravet. Nesta última situação, a DGS até veio a correr informar que a jovem não estava vacinada. Agora, com o pequeno Rodrigo saiu-se com escrúpulos, e nada avançou, a não ser negar que não foi a vacina. Há escrúpulos convenientes.

  title: 'Lockdowns Fail: They Do Not Control the Virus'
  date: 2021-07-25
  description: "
    The use of universal lockdowns in the event of the appearance of a new pathogen has no precedent. It has been a science experiment in real-time, with most of the human population used as lab rats. The question is whether and to what extent lockdowns worked to control the virus in a way that is scientifically verifiable. Based on the following studies, the answer is no and for a variety of reasons: bad data, no correlations, no causal demonstration, anomalous exceptions, and so on. There is no relationship between lockdowns (or whatever else people want to call them to mask their true nature) and virus control.
