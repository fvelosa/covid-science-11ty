#### What are your main goals while building this website?

Help friends and the society in general to overcome these extremelly difficult times.

#### Do you have conflict of interestes?

Yes, I don't have any direct relationship with pharma or health but all instituions nowadays censor and cancel their employees.
Being a consultant that is regularly checked for every new contract all my content is somehow self-censored.

#### Do you have enought knowledge address this subject?

Not at all. Use this content at your own responsability.

#### Why most content challenges the mainstream narrative?

You don't need my help for the mainstream narrative, just type any ramdom url in your browser, turn the TV or buy a newspaper for that.

#### Are you a covid denier?

I think COVID can be a very dangerous virus that has severe consequences for certains groups of people, like the elderly and insulin resistant.
But I also believe the health crisis as been extremelly exagerated for political and financial goals.

#### Are you an anti-vaxer?

Absolutely not, 2 years ago you would hear me complaining about the return of deseases that had been erradicated because of anti-vaxer behaviour.

#### Based on your experience what would be your pesonal recommendations?

These are my principles, they don't apply to most people.

Always check with your doctor and think about your lifestyle and risk profile, we are all different.

1. Have a healthy life style, easier said than done but low stress, sports, food, sun and sleep are extremelly important
2. Take the profilatic recommendations from top experts like FLCCC or Vladimir Zelenko
3. Not anymore, 2 Months ago I would have recommended to take the vaccine if you were over 65 but the data is just too scary
4. Never, ever vaccinate your children or youngsters
5. Prepare for COVID, prepare your house, suplies and medicine, you will get it for sure. If not you can help a friend.
6. Keep informed with top health experts but don't follow main stream media, I always get impressed how ignorant, dumb and corrupt they are.
7. Fight but don't insult your covido-nazy friends, most of them are nice people that are living in fear and have been brainwashed
8. Participate in has many freedom events as possible and support content creators, small contributions matter
9. Speak out but don't compromise too much, there is no point in losing your inner support circle or loosing access to your social-media resources
