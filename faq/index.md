#### What are your main goals while building this website?

Help friends and society to overcome these extremely difficult times.

#### Do you have conflicts of interest?

Yes, I don't have any direct relationship with pharma or health but all institutions nowadays censor and cancel their employees.
Being a consultant that is regularly checked for every new contract all my content is somehow self-censored.

#### Do you have enough knowledge to address this subject?

Not at all. Use this content at your responsibility.

#### Why do most content challenge the mainstream narrative?

You don't need my help for the mainstream narrative, just type any random URL in your browser, turn the TV or buy a newspaper for that.

#### Are you a covid denier?

I think COVID can be a very dangerous virus with severe health consequences for certain groups of people, like the elderly and imuno-compromised.

But I also believe the health crisis has been extremely exaggerated for political and financial gains.

#### Are you an anti-vaxer?

Absolutely not, 2 years ago you would hear me complaining about the return of diseases that had been eradicated because of anti-vaxer behaviour.

#### Based on your experience what would be your recommendations?

These are my principles, they don't apply to most people.

Always check with your doctor and think about your lifestyle and risk profile, we are all different.

1. Have a healthy lifestyle, easier said than done but low stress, sports, food, sun and sleep are extremely important
2. Take the prophylactic recommendations from top experts like FLCCC or Vladimir Zelenko
3. Carefully review this content compare it with other sources before taking the vaccine
4. Never, ever vaccinate your children or youngsters
5. Prepare for COVID, prepare your house, supplies and medicine, you will get it for sure. If not you can help a friend.
6. Keep informed with top health experts but don't follow mainstream media, I always get impressed by how ignorant, dumb and corrupt they are.
7. Fight but don't insult your covido-nazy friends, most of them are nice people that are living in fear and have been brainwashed
8. Participate in as many freedom events as possible and support content creators, small contributions matter
9. Speak out but evaluate how much you can compromise, there is no point in losing your inner support circle or risking your family income
